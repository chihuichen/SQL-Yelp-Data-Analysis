# Overview
I am interested in finding restaurants that "punch above their weight" by having ratings (stars) that are above their category averages. \
However, a restaurant can have multiple categories on Yelp. Each category has its own category average rating. \
So in I will write some SQL to find restaurants with ratings that are greater than all of their category average ratings.
